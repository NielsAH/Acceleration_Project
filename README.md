# Investigating accelerometry data as a potential tool to help understand rare diseases

## Information
This GitHub page is used to share the code and computations to the thesis project on accelerometer data. 
It also includes example clustering using 4-medoids, using a least squares MDS visualisation into three dimensions for different dissimilariaties, as described in the thesis. These can be found in the Section 5 medoid folder.
All other code is also roughly included by section. However, the files have not been reorganised. Some of the code did not make the thesis, and some of the code for images in the thesis can be at surprising places. 
Only one data example file is included, other raw data files have been omitted due to privacy concerns and file size (and are not part of this project's history either).

## Required packages / dependencies
Several CRAN R packages have been included in this project. They need to be installed for at least some code to work.

In addition, although file paths are local, some names have been changed when making the project ready for GitHub.
Please note that changing some paths manually may be necessary even when cloning the full project as uploaded here.

## Contact me
You can contact me through e-mail: heij [no space] nekampni [no space] els [at] gma [no space] il [dot] com. 
I welcome anyone to do so for the following reasons.
- You cannot find any computations mentioned in the thesis that you are interested in.
- You cannot replicate any computations mentioned in the thesis that you are interested in.
- You have found a privacy or safety concern within my data.
- You have questions about the missing data in the code, or other data mentioned in the thesis. We can discuss which data can be shared through consulation with the WKZ/UMC.
- You have any other question about the code or thesis.
